<p>Chiron Hei HK (昭源黑體) is a Traditional Chinese sans typeface based on Adobe’s Source Han Sans (a.k.a. Google’s Noto Sans CJK). The font aims at providing a modern, region-agnostic glyph set adopting the “modern” glyph style that is similar to the prevailing, usually commercial, typefaces in the Traditional Chinese regions.</p>
