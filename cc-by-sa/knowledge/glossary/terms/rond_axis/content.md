“Roundness” (ROND in CSS) is an axis found in some variable fonts that can be used to change shapes from sharp and angular defaults to rounded versions.

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: | Min: | Max: | Step: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 100 | 1 |

In Wavefont, manipulating this axis results in changing the rectangular bar chart style to one that has a large border radius at the top and bottom of each bar. This axis is similar, but subtly different, to the Softness axis.
