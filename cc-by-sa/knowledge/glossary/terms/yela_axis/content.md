“Vertical Element Alignment” (YELA in CSS) is an axis found in some variable fonts that can be used to align elements within modular typefaces’ glyphs to different positions in the Y dimension.

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: | Min: | Max: | Step: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | -100 | 100 | 1 |
