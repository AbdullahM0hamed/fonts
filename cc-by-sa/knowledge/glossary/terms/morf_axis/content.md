“Morph” (MORF in CSS) is an axis found in some [variable fonts](/glossary/variable_fonts) that can be used to unconventionally change the shape, size, and position of elements that make up a letterform. 

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: | Min: | Max: | Step: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 60 | 1 |

In the [Kablammo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kablammo) font, moving along the axis from its minimum to maximum value animates the elements that are changing. Some glyphs use this to suggest actual movement as the axis is altered.
