“Flare” (FLAR in CSS) is an axis found in some variable fonts that can be used to control how the strokes modulate from their upright parts to their flared extremes.

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: | Min: | Max: | Step: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 100 | 1 |

Left at the minimum value, the strokes are monolinear; at the maximum value, more contrast is introduced to the letterforms. The effect is more noticeable in heavier font weights.
